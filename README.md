HackTheNorth
============

Our Myo hack for the HackTheNorth Hackathon September 19th 2014

##Requirements##
In order to build, you first need to add these Standard Assets. Click on `Assets>Import Package>` for the following Assets:
	
- Character Control
- Scripts
- Skyboxes
- Terrain

Additionally, this project uses:
- the Rune Sword asset located [here in the Unity Asset Store](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/12152)
- OculusUnityIntegration unitypackage and the Oculus SDK

##TODO in the Future##
- Keep gitignore updated in such a way that large asset files and samples are ignored
